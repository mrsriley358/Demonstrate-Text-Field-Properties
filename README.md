# Demonstrate Text Field Properties

The project was to demonstrate text field properties through writing a program that sets the horizontal alignment and column-size properties of a text field dynamically.

## Analysis Steps

The project was to make a graphic user interface to set the horizontal alignment and column size properties of a text field dynamically. This solution required the use of Radio Buttons, Text Fields, Labels, and handlers in horizontal and vertical boxes. 


### Design

Through breaking it down into pieces, first with a horizontal box, buttons, and text fields, then with the radio buttons and another horizontal box, and finally with handlers to change things. 

### Testing

Simply starting up the application, one can type into the text field, click on the radio buttons to change the horizontal orientation of the text, and finally with manipulating the column size through entering the desired number column size and pressing enter.
